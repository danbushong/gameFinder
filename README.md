## Description
Web page that automatically recommends a game based on the genre you select, complete with a relevant YouTube video, and useful information on the game.

We used the [RAWG Video Game Database API](https://api.rawg.io/docs/) to generate the random game and its information, and the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to generate a relevant video about the game.
